## Problem #1
###### (*25 points*)
##### *Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:*

The following code imports the designated excel file, specifically the sheet named "Mr. Trash Wheel." There is a graphic displayed in the first row of the sheet, so I opted to skip that row when importing. Thereafter, I cleaned the column/variable names by converting them into the ever sexy "snake_case." Then I dropped the column that contained notes and removed all the rows that did not have dumpster-specific data. Lastly, I rounded the variable `sports_balls` to the nearest integer and mutated it from a `dbl` to an `int`.

```{r read_in_mr_trash_wheel_data, message = FALSE}
mr_tw_df <-
    read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
               sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    select(-x15, -x16, -x17) %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = as.integer(
            round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
```

The following code imports the designated excel file, specifically the sheet named "2017 Precipitation." There is no graphic in this sheet, but there is an additional row of header text; I skipped that row when importing. Thereafter, I cleaned the column names as before, removed rows with missing data in the `month` column, and added a new column: `year` with `2017` as its observations.  

```{r read_in_2017_precipitation data}
precip_2017 <-
    read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
               sheet = "2017 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = "2017")
```

The following code does everything that the previous code does, with some small changes. The sheet named "2018 Precipitation" was imported, and the addition of the `year` column reflected `2018` as its observations.  

```{r read_in_2018_precipitation data}
precip_2018 <-
    read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
               sheet = "2018 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate(year = "2018")
```

The following code binds both the `precip_2017` and `precip_2018` tibbles into one, mutates the `month` vector from a `dbl` to a `chr`, and arranges them as such: `year` > `month` > `total`.

```{r combining_precip_data}
precip_1718 <-
    bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>% 
    mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
    select(year, month, total)
```

Let's give a brief rundown on our tibbles: In `2017` there were `r count(filter(precip_2017, total > 0))` months that had precipitation, though we had data for all months. In `2018`, of the `r nrow(precip_2018)` months' worth of data there were `r count(filter(precip_2018, total > 0))` months with precipitation. The `precip_2017` tibble had a reported total precipitation of `r sum(pull(precip_2017, total))` inches. The `precip_2018` tibble had a reported total precipitation of `r sum(pull(precip_2018, total))` inches. There was a net decrease of `r sum(pull(precip_2017, total)) - sum(pull(precip_2018, total))` inches from `2017` to `2018`. The `mr_tw_df` had far more information than the two aforementioned tibbles. (`r ncol(mr_tw_df)` columns vs. `r ncol(precip_2017)` and `r ncol(precip_2018)` columns, respectively.) That tibble included key variables such as: `dumpster`, `plastic_bottles`, `cigarette_butts`, `grocery bags`, and `sports_balls`, which, what is a sports ball? (Anyone?) Regardless of what it is, in `2017` the median number of `sports_balls` in a dumpster was `r mr_tw_df %>% filter(year == 2017) %>% pull(sports_balls) %>% median()` balls.

##### *Read and Merge 538.com Datasets:*

The following code imports the three 538.com (.csv) datasets into our working environment.

```{r read_in_three_538_excel_files, message = FALSE}
pols_month <- read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv")
unemployment <- read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv")
snp <- read_csv("./data/snp.csv")
```

The following code pertains to the `pols_month` data. We separate the singular `mon` variable into its component parts of `year`, `month`, and `day`. This makes for much easier data cleaning. And to reduce clutter and unnecessary observations, we integrate the logical values of `prez_dem` and `prez_gop` into a single column `president`. It is now easier to identify when the president in office was either a Republican (`gop`) or Democrat (`dem`) based on their recoded values. And lastly, we drop the columns we no longer need: `prez_gop`, `prez_dem`, and `day`. [Note: there was no cleaning of variable names needed for this dataset]

```{r clean_pols_month_data, results = FALSE}
pols_month <- 
    pols_month %>% 
    separate(
        mon, into = (c("year", "month", "day")), remove = TRUE, convert = TRUE) %>%
    mutate(
        month = month.name[month],
        prez_dem = if_else(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop"),
        president = prez_dem) %>%
    select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem, day))
```

The following code pertains to the `snp` data. Again, we separate the singular `date` variable into its component parts of `year`, `month`, and `day`. And then we utilize an R constant `month.name[]` to recode our new `month` variable to apply the month names to the observations. Lastly, we arrange our columns to match the order of `pols_month`: `year`, `month`, `close`. This will make our joining of datasets process work smoothly in the coming steps. We also dropped the unneeded `day` variable. Sorry, `day`. [Note: there was no cleaning of variable names needed for this dataset]

```{r clean_snp_data, results = FALSE}
snp <-
    snp %>%
    separate(date, into = (c("month", "day", "year")), remove = TRUE, convert = TRUE) %>%
    mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>%
    select(year, month, close, -day)
```

The following code includes some additional data wrangling, as compared to the two previous code chunks. This code pertains to the `unemployment` data. We shift our data to be more tidy by pulling the month (`Jan:Dec`) columns down to rows. Additionally, we have to do some data acrobatics to get the months converted to integers, then month abbreviations, and then month names. It was rough, but we got there. Lastly, we cleaned up the variable names.

```{r clean_unemployment_data, results = FALSE}
unemployment <-
    unemployment %>%
    pivot_longer(
        Jan:Dec,
        names_to = "Month",
        values_to = "Pct_Unemp") %>%
    mutate(
        Year = as.integer(Year),
        Month = match(Month, month.abb),
        Month = month.name[Month]) %>%
    janitor::clean_names()
```

The following code pertains to all three of the imported and cleaned 538.com datasets. First, we join the `snp` data into the `pols_month` via a `left_join()` because we want to add values from `snp` into `pols_month`. We match by both `year` and `month`. Next, we repeat the same process, except that `unemployment` will now be joined to the previously joined dataset `pols_snp`. The final product is a combined, cleaned, and tidy `pols_snp_unemp` dataset.

```{r join_all_538_datasets}
pols_snp <- left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
pols_snp_unemp <- left_join(pols_snp, unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

What we have here are three separate datasets (`pols_months`, `snp`, and `unemployment`) containing US political office, stock market, and unemployment data on the national level. (Side note: 538 nailed every election prediction until...well, you know.) The `pols_month` dataset (after cleaning) contained `r ncol(pols_month)` variables, which included data on the overall count of political representation in both the Legislative and Executive branches of government for any given month and year. The year range for the data covered from `r min(pull(pols_snp_unemp, year))` through `r max(pull(pols_snp_unemp, year))`.

##### *BABY NAMES! BABY NAMES! BABY NAMES!:*

The following code thoroughly cleans, mutates, and coerces the dataset concerning popular [baby names](https://youtu.be/JAfSjh6_2Jk?t=54). We remove duplicates by converting `childs_first_name` to the same case, and account for the different character descriptions for the same ethnicity (i.e., `asian and paci` vs. `asian and pacific islander`) by way of a simple recode. Lastly, we remove all the duplicate rows where `year_of_birth`, `ethnicity`, and `childs_first_name` match other rows.

```{r clean_baby_name_data, message = FALSE}
#COMPLETED
baby_data <-
    read_csv("./data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    mutate(
        childs_first_name = str_to_lower(childs_first_name),
        ethnicity = str_to_lower(ethnicity),
        ethnicity = as.factor(ethnicity),
        ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, 
                        "asian and paci" = "asian and pacific islander",
                        "black non hisp" = "black non hispanic",
                        "white non hisp" = "white non hispanic"),
        gender = str_to_lower(gender),
        gender = as.factor(gender),
        year_of_birth = as.integer(year_of_birth)) %>% 
    distinct(year_of_birth, ethnicity, childs_first_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

The following code sets us up to generate a table showing the ranking of the name `Olivia` among each of the four ethnicities for the years 2011 through 2016.

```{r generate_table_olivia}
#COMPLETED
baby_data <-
    filter(baby_data, childs_first_name == "olivia") %>%
    select(-c("gender", "childs_first_name", "count")) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = "year_of_birth",
        values_from = "rank") %>% 
    knitr::kable(align = 'c')
```

This simple call generates our nice and tidy table.

```{r display_table}
baby_data
```


```{r generate_table_male_names, eval = FALSE}
#TO BE COMPLETED
```

```{r scatterplot_of_names, eval = FALSE}
#TO BE COMPLETED
```
