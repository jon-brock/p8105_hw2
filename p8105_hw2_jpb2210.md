## Problem \#1

###### (*25 points*)

##### *Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:*

The following code imports the designated excel file, specifically the
sheet named “Mr. Trash Wheel.” There is a graphic displayed in the first
row of the sheet, so I opted to skip that row when importing.
Thereafter, I cleaned the column/variable names by converting them into
the ever sexy “snake\_case.” Then I dropped the column that contained
notes and removed all the rows that did not have dumpster-specific data.
Lastly, I rounded the variable `sports_balls` to the nearest integer and
mutated it from a `dbl` to an `int`.

``` r
mr_tw_df <-
    read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
               sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    select(-x15, -x16, -x17) %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = as.integer(
            round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
```

The following code imports the designated excel file, specifically the
sheet named “2017 Precipitation.” There is no graphic in this sheet, but
there is an additional row of header text; I skipped that row when
importing. Thereafter, I cleaned the column names as before, removed
rows with missing data in the `month` column, and added a new column:
`year` with `2017` as its observations.

``` r
precip_2017 <-
    read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
               sheet = "2017 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = "2017")
```

The following code does everything that the previous code does, with
some small changes. The sheet named “2018 Precipitation” was imported,
and the addition of the `year` column reflected `2018` as its
observations.

``` r
precip_2018 <-
    read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
               sheet = "2018 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate(year = "2018")
```

The following code binds both the `precip_2017` and `precip_2018`
tibbles into one, mutates the `month` vector from a `dbl` to a `chr`,
and arranges them as such: `year` \> `month` \> `total`.

``` r
precip_1718 <-
    bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>% 
    mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
    select(year, month, total)
```

Let’s give a brief rundown on our tibbles: In `2017` there were 11
months that had precipitation, though we had data for all months. In
`2018`, of the 12 months’ worth of data there were 12 months with
precipitation. The `precip_2017` tibble had a reported total
precipitation of 32.93 inches. The `precip_2018` tibble had a reported
total precipitation of 70.33 inches. There was a net decrease of -37.4
inches from `2017` to `2018`. The `mr_tw_df` had far more information
than the two aforementioned tibbles. (14 columns vs. 3 and 3 columns,
respectively.) That tibble included key variables such as: `dumpster`,
`plastic_bottles`, `cigarette_butts`, `grocery bags`, and
`sports_balls`, which, what is a sports ball? (Anyone?) Regardless of
what it is, in `2017` the median number of `sports_balls` in a dumpster
was 8 balls.

``` r

pols_month <- read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv")
unemployment <- read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv")
snp <- read_csv("./data/snp.csv")
```

``` r

pols_month %>%
    separate(
        mon, into = (c("year", "month", "day")), remove = TRUE, convert = TRUE) %>%
    mutate(
        month = month.name[month],
        prez_dem = if_else(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop"),
        president = prez_dem) %>%
    select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem, day))
```

``` r

    separate(date, into = (c("month", "day", "year")), remove = TRUE, convert = TRUE) %>%
    mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>%
    select(year, month, close, -day)

##### *BABY NAMES\! BABY NAMES\! BABY NAMES\!:*

``` r
baby_data <- #GOOD CODE
    read_csv("./data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% #GOOD CODE
    janitor::clean_names() %>% #GOOD CODE
    mutate(
        childs_first_name = str_to_lower(childs_first_name),
        ethnicity = str_to_lower(ethnicity),
        gender = str_to_lower(gender)) %>% 
    distinct(childs_first_name, .keep_all = TRUE) #GOOD CODE

``` r
baby_data %>% #TEST CODE - NOT FINALIZED
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = year_of_birth,
        values_from = childs_first_name)
```

    ## Warning: Values in `childs_first_name` are not uniquely identified; output will contain list-cols.
    ## * Use `values_fn = list(childs_first_name = list)` to suppress this warning.
    ## * Use `values_fn = list(childs_first_name = length)` to identify where the duplicates arise
    ## * Use `values_fn = list(childs_first_name = summary_fun)` to summarise duplicates
