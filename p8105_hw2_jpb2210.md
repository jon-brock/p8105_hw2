## Problem \#1

###### (*25 points*)

##### *Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:*

The following code imports the designated excel file, specifically the
sheet named “Mr. Trash Wheel.” There is a graphic displayed in the first
row of the sheet, so I opted to skip that row when importing.
Thereafter, I cleaned the column/variable names by converting them into
the ever sexy “snake\_case.” Then I dropped the column that contained
notes and removed all the rows that did not have dumpster-specific data.
Lastly, I rounded the variable `sports_balls` to the nearest integer and
mutated it from a `dbl` to an `int`.

``` r
mr_tw_df <-
    read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
               sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    select(-x15, -x16, -x17) %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = as.integer(
            round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
```

The following code imports the designated excel file, specifically the
sheet named “2017 Precipitation.” There is no graphic in this sheet, but
there is an additional row of header text; I skipped that row when
importing. Thereafter, I cleaned the column names as before, removed
rows with missing data in the `month` column, and added a new column:
`year` with `2017` as its observations.

``` r
precip_2017 <-
    read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
               sheet = "2017 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = "2017")
```

The following code does everything that the previous code does, with
some small changes. The sheet named “2018 Precipitation” was imported,
and the addition of the `year` column reflected `2018` as its
observations.

``` r
precip_2018 <-
    read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
               sheet = "2018 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate(year = "2018")
```

The following code binds both the `precip_2017` and `precip_2018`
tibbles into one, mutates the `month` vector from a `dbl` to a `chr`,
and arranges them as such: `year` \> `month` \> `total`.

``` r
precip_1718 <-
    bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>% 
    mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
    select(year, month, total)
```

Let’s give a brief rundown on our tibbles: In `2017` there were 11
months that had precipitation, though we had data for all months. In
`2018`, of the 12 months’ worth of data there were 12 months with
precipitation. The `precip_2017` tibble had a reported total
precipitation of 32.93 inches. The `precip_2018` tibble had a reported
total precipitation of 70.33 inches. There was a net decrease of -37.4
inches from `2017` to `2018`. The `mr_tw_df` had far more information
than the two aforementioned tibbles. (14 columns vs. 3 and 3 columns,
respectively.) That tibble included key variables such as: `dumpster`,
`plastic_bottles`, `cigarette_butts`, `grocery bags`, and
`sports_balls`, which, what is a sports ball? (Anyone?) Regardless of
what it is, in `2017` the median number of `sports_balls` in a dumpster
was 8 balls.

##### *Read and Merge 538.com Datasets:*

``` r
#COMPLETED
pols_month <- read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv")
unemployment <- read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv")
snp <- read_csv("./data/snp.csv")
```

``` r
#COMPLETED
pols_month %>%
    separate(
        mon, into = (c("year", "month", "day")), remove = TRUE, convert = TRUE) %>%
    mutate(
        month = month.name[month],
        prez_dem = if_else(prez_dem == 1, "dem", "gop"),
        president = prez_dem) %>%
    select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem, day))
```

``` r
#COMPLETED
snp %>%
    separate(date, into = (c("month", "day", "year")), remove = TRUE, convert = TRUE) %>%
    mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>%
    select(year, month, close, -day)
```

``` r
#COMPLETED
unemployment %>% #GOOD CODE
    pivot_longer( #GOOD CODE
        Jan:Dec, #GOOD CODE
        names_to = "Month", #GOOD CODE
        values_to = "Pct_Unemp") %>% #GOOD CODE
    mutate(
        Year = as.integer(Year),
        Month = match(Month, month.abb),
        Month = month.name[Month]) %>%  #GOOD CODE
    janitor::clean_names()
```

``` r
pols_snp <- left_join(pols_month, snp, by = c("year" = "year", "month" = "month"))
```

What we have here are three separate datasets (`pols_months`, `snp`, and
`unemployment`) containing US political office, stock market, and
unemployment data on the national level. (Side note: 538 nailed every
election prediction until…well, you know.) The `pols_months` dataset
(after cleaning) contained 9 variables, which included data on the
overall count of political representations in both the Legislative and
Executive branches of government for any given month and year. For
example, in April ’62 there were Democratic Senators and `XXX` GOP
Senators in the US Senate.

``` r
#COMPLETED
baby_data <- #GOOD CODE

        ethnicity = as.factor(ethnicity),
        gender = str_to_lower(gender),
        gender = as.factor(gender),
        year_of_birth = as.integer(year_of_birth)) %>%

        names_from = year_of_birth,
        values_from = childs_first_name) %>% 
    group_by(ethnicity)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 5
