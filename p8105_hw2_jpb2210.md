## Problem \#1

###### (*25 points*)

##### *Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:*

The following code imports the designated excel file, specifically the
sheet named “Mr. Trash Wheel.” There is a graphic displayed in the first
row of the sheet, so I opted to skip that row when importing.
Thereafter, I cleaned the column/variable names by converting them into
the ever sexy “snake\_case.” Then I dropped the column that contained
notes and removed all the rows that did not have dumpster-specific data.
Lastly, I rounded the variable `sports_balls` to the nearest integer and
mutated it from a `dbl` to an `int`.

``` r
#[COMPLETED] THIS CODE WORKS! DO NOT CHANGE IT! TAKE OUT THIS MESSAGE WHEN ASSIGNMENT IS COMPLETED!
mr_tw_df <-
    read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
               sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    select(-x15) %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = as.integer(
            round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
```

The following code imports the designated excel file, specifically the
sheet named “2017 Precipitation.” There is no graphic in this sheet, but
there is an additional row of header text; I skipped that row when
importing. Thereafter, I cleaned the column names as before, removed
rows with missing data in the `month` column, and added a new column:
`year` with `2017` as its observations.

``` r
#THIS CODE WORKS! DO NOT CHANGE IT! TAKE OUT THIS MESSAGE WHEN ASSIGNMENT IS COMPLETED!
precip_2017 <-
    read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
               sheet = "2017 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = "2017")
```

The following code does everything that the previous code does, with
some small changes. The sheet named “2018 Precipitation” was imported,
and the addition of the `year` column reflected `2018` as its
observations.

``` r
#THIS CODE WORKS! DO NOT CHANGE IT! TAKE OUT THIS MESSAGE WHEN ASSIGNMENT IS COMPLETED!
precip_2018 <-
    read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
               sheet = "2018 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate(year = "2018")
```
